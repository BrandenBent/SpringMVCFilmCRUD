### This application demonstrates basic knowledge of Full-Stack development for week 8 of the Skill Distillery Bootcamp.

### Developer(s) Branden B, Gabriel A., Connor C.

### Overview: The MVC File Site project uses C.R.U.D - Create Update & Delete methodology using backend java to speak to a pre-fabricated mySQL database listing movies and their various metadata and displaying that data via front-end code through .jsp, HTML and .xml files. This full-stack program allows a user to search a database for films' data via a localhost website. Some of the options the user is able to engage in are entering a movie id or keyword to search for a movie. If an id or keyword matches a movie within the database that movie is pulled from the database and displayed to the user on the webpage. The user is also allowed to create their own movies and then add those movies to the database. The user has the option to delete their own created movies from the database. If the user enters a parameter that is out of bounds of the database, the program informs the user.

### Technologies used: Java, SpringToolSuite4, Gradle, Atom, Git, mySQL, Unix Terminal, HTML, .jsp, .xml, MAMP, MySQL Workbench

### Lessons Learned: creating our first full-stack application through various coding languages in an agile-style programming environment.
